# weatherApp
The weatherApp project is a simple and intuitive weather forecasting tool that uses the leaflet library and two APIs to provide users with a map-based interface and real-time weather information. By interacting with the map, users can select a location and view a small forecast for that location, including current temperature and weather conditions. The app uses one API to retrieve the geolocation data for the selected location and another API to retrieve the weather forecast information.

Overall, weatherApp provides an easy and convenient way to access up-to-date weather information for any location on the map. Whether you're planning a trip, checking the weather for your daily commute, or simply curious about the weather in a new location, weatherApp has you covered.
